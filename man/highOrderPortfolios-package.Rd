\title{highOrderPortfolios: Design of High-Order Portfolios via Mean, Variance, Skewness, and Kurtosis}
\description{
The classical Markowitz's mean-variance portfolio formulation ignores 
heavy tails and skewness. High-order portfolios use higher order moments to
better characterize the return distribution. Different formulations and fast 
algorithms are proposed for high-order portfolios based on the mean, variance, 
skewness, and kurtosis.
