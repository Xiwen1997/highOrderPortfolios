Title: Design of High-Order Portfolios via Mean, Variance, Skewness, and Kurtosis
Version: 0.0.1
Date: 2020-7-30
Description: The classical Markowitz's mean-variance portfolio formulation ignores 
    heavy tails and skewness. High-order portfolios use higher order moments to
    better characterize the return distribution. Different formulations and fast 
    algorithms are proposed for high-order portfolios based on the mean, variance, 
    skewness, and kurtosis.
    The package is based on the paper: Zhou and Palomar (2020).
